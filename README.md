- 👋 Hi, I’m @VirVieira
- 👀 I’m interested in android development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning I am currently studying Kotlin. It has been challenging, because I started in this niche in 2023 and I am really enjoying it because it is challenging in every way, because I am from the humanities area.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that stimulate daily learning and that can develop skills that I don't yet know
- 📫 How to reach me [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/virg%C3%ADnia-m-neres-vieira/)
- 😄 Pronouns: Vir, Vivi
- ⚡ Fun fact: I discovered that I no longer have the courage to go to amusement parks
